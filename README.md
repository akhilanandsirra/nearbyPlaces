# Nearby Places

Nearby Places is an android mobile application which allows
to search for nearby places through geolocation, distance using Google Maps API. It is able to search places, As many target
users are used to walking to these places, so we thought to allow the users to set
desired radius in the nearby search.

In Google Maps, we can search a nearby location but we cannot set
the desired radius of the search parameter.

Even if we can set the radius the options in google maps are very limited and
always hidden somewhere as seen below.
