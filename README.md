# Nearby Places

Nearby Places is an android mobile application which allows
to search for nearby places through geolocation, distance. In fact, the
concept of proximity is relative, and it depends from distance itself. So, the android mobile application is able to search places, and we know that many target
users are used to walking to these places, so we thought to allow the users to set
desired radius in the nearby search.

In Google Maps, we can search a nearby location but we cannot set
the desired radius of the search parameter.

Even if we can set the radius the options in google maps are very limited and
always hidden somewhere as seen below.



The Options available are:
* 400 Metres
* 800 Metres
* 2 Kilometres
* 10 Kilometres
* 30 Kilometres
